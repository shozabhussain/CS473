To run this example you must have python installed (tested with version 2.6
and version 2.7), and sqlite3.

To run the amagon web server:

	python webserver.py

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/ for amagon.com.  (You may be able to visit
http://localhost:8080/ , but on some systems that doesn't work, as the
browser tries to find www.localhost.com.)
